Growth mindset to me is an understanding that learning and adapting is necessary for the best possible outcome.
## to keep myself in a growth mindset I will
*1. **Always** look to learn something new
*2. **Ask questions** and *collaborate*  with others
*3. Get comfortable with difficulty and never ~give up~
