* the **command line** in the terminal is the place to communicate most directly with your computer.
* It is important to know where you are in the terminal, what is there and what you plan to do.
* take the time to get it set up correctly. This will take time. It wont work perfectly the first time.
* all text editors are not the same, some offer very basic coding structure options and others will work with you and predict the bits of code you need based on what you type. It is important that you select the text editor that works best for you.
